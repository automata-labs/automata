Kernel

This repository contains the contracts for abstracting governor tokens
into their repsective voting- and non-voting token primitives.

The contracts are all replaceable except for the kernel contract that
contains all of the states of the system. The protocol is token agnostic
and can have multiple implementations of both voting tokens and
-emulators. The kernel is thus upgradeable in tandem with governance
model upgrades and built with this adaptability in mind. Additional
desireable abstractions in the future are resolved by deploying
complementing pair-wise splitting contracts.
